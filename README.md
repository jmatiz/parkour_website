# parkour_website
A small website about Parkour that showcases using the Bootstrap framework. HTML was used for the layout, CSS for design, and Javascript was used to create interactivity. The landing page is a looped video that has three visible icons and three hidden icons that lead to different information. Click on the eye in the top center to toggle the three hidden icons.
